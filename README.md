## Description
In realworld situations developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). The assignment was designed to allow a similar purpose. This week I was able to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. 

## User Story
As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone SSH git@github.com:lvdean/Employee-database-tracker.git

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application 

To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node server.js.
